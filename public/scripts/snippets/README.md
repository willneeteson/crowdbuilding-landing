# JavaScript Snippets

This directory contains reusable JavaScript features, utilities, and code snippets that can be used across the project.

## Purpose

- Store small, reusable JavaScript functions and features
- Maintain a collection of utility functions
- Share common code patterns
- Keep the codebase DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

## Usage

Each snippet should be:
- Well-documented with comments
- Self-contained
- Easy to import and use
- Include usage examples where appropriate

## Structure

Snippets can be organized by category or functionality. Consider creating subdirectories for different types of snippets:

- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `animations/` - Animation-related code
- `ui/` - UI-related features
- `data/` - Data manipulation functions

## Adding New Snippets

When adding new snippets:
1. Create a new file with a descriptive name
2. Include JSDoc comments for documentation
3. Add usage examples
4. Update this README if necessary
